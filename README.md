#My Sandbox

This is just a place for me to upload code and projects where I'm either learning stuff
or playing around.

## Languages

The code is brokn down by the language its written in.  These are:

### C++
Typically this is where I'm updating my skills on the system level stuff and playing with projects at a low level

### Python
Lots of data science stuff, general purpose coding and fast prototyping of code

### Goloang
Learning Golang from scratch.  Probably full of a lot of simple stuff for now

### C#
Probably won't see much in here, but of I need to do something quickly in C#, this is where you'll find it

### Web
As teh name suggests, this is web dev stuff, like CSS and JS playground.
