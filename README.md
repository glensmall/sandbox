# Sandbox
My Sandbox


This is just a place for me to upload code and projects where I'm either learning stuff
or playing around.  Nothing special in here, its just a playground as the name suggests.

## Languages

The code is brokn down by the language its written in.  These are:

### Golang
This is where I play around and learn new stuff about Golang.  I'm spending time doing stuff in go that I might have previously done in C++.

### C++
Revisiting code from 20 years ago and playing around with new syntax and styles.  

### Python
Lots of data science stuff, general purpose coding and fast prototyping of code.  Love Python and its cross capabilities. 

### C#
Probably won't see much in here, but of I need to do something quickly in C#, this is where you'll find it
